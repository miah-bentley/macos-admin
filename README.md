# macos-scripts
Scripts to support with various MacOS configurations

Pardon my dust while I desensitize some things to make them ready for public use

Please feel free to use these scripts as you see fit, I hope they help.

Most of these were made while I was teaching myself bash and have not been revisited since I've learned more and moved to using big-boy MDM like Jamf.
